# Overlap

Algorithm description

Write a method that calculate overlapping area of two rectangles. Parameters of the method are coordinates of bottom-left and top-right corners of both rectangles. You should write tests for that method, covering all important cases. If you want to try, you can write unit tests with JUnit. But if you don't want, you can create your own simple testing methods that will be run from inside of your main class.
Input data

All parameters of your method should follow these rules (names are used for explanation, use parameters names that you think are understandable and clean):

    Both x and y of all corners are integrers, and can have both positive and negative values.
    bottom-left-x - integer, possible values range: -2 147 483 648 <= bottom-left-x <= 2 147 483 647
    bottom-left-y - integer, possible values range: -2 147 483 648 <= bottom-left-x <= 2 147 483 647
    top-right-x - integer, possible values range: -2 147 483 648 <= bottom-left-x <= 2 147 483 647
    top-right-y - integer, possible values range: -2 147 483 648 <= bottom-left-x <= 2 147 483 647
